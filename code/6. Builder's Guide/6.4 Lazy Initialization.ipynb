    "$z_t$ is the mean vector of the distribution, representing the expected value or average of the random variable. As before, it is a vector because we're dealing with a multivariate normal distribution.\n",

    "$\\sigma^2_tI$ represents the covariance matrix of the distribution. Here, $\\sigma^2_t$ is the variance parameter, determining the spread or dispersion of the distribution. The term $I$ denotes the identity matrix, which is a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Multiplying $\\sigma^2_tI$ by $\\sigma^2_t$ scales the identity matrix by the variance parameter, resulting in a covariance matrix with equal variances across all dimensions.\n",
    "In summary, the notation $\\mathcal{N}(z_t;\\alpha_tx, \\sigma^2_tI)$ describes a multivariate normal distribution with mean $z_t$, possibly scaled by $\\alpha_tx$, and covariance matrix $\\sigma^2_tI$."
