    "So far we discussed how to process data and how to build, train, and test deep learning models. However, at some point, we will hopefully be happy enough with the learned models that we will want to save the results for later use in various contexts (perhaps even to make predictions in deployment). Additionally, when running a long training process, the best practice is to periodically save intermediate results (checkpointing) to ensure that we do not lose several days worth of computation if we trip over the power cord of our server. Thus it is time to learn how to load and store both individual weight vectors and entire models. This section addresses both issues."

    "Saving individual weight vectors (or other tensors) is useful, but it gets very tedious if we want to save (and later load) an entire model. After all, we might have hundreds of parameter groups sprinkled throughout. For this reason the deep learning framework provides built-in functionalities to load and save entire networks. An important detail to note is that $\\textbf{this saves model parameters and not the entire model}$. For example, if we have a 3-layer MLP, we need to specify the architecture separately. The reason for this is that the models themselves can contain arbitrary code, hence they cannot be serialized as naturally. Thus, in order to reinstate a model, we need to generate the architecture in code and then load the parameters from disk. Let’s start with our familiar MLP."
